Lost Paradise - 3 day music festival held over New Years in NSW, Australia. I was invited along as the private photographer for popular Sydney band, Mammals. Mammals played alongside some huge international acts such as RÃ¼fus, Cigarettes After Sex and Matt Corby. This was my second year shooting with the Lost Paradise team and I'm so stoked to be heading back for a third year to shoot with them!
